# Chapter 2. A Tiny Imperative Programming Language

Design *TIP* (tiny imperative programming language) for following chapters.

## 2.1. The Syntax of TIP

TIP programs interact with the world simply by reading input from a stream of integers (for example obtained from the userâ€™s keyboard) and writing output as another stream of integers (to the userâ€™s screen).
The language lacks many features known from commonly used programming languages, for example, global variables, nested functions, objects, and type annotations.

- Basic Expressions
  ```
  I -> 0 | 1 | -1 | 2 | -2 | ...       (integer constant)
  X -> x | y | z | ...                 (variable)
  E -> I                               (expression)
     | X
     | E + E | E - E | E * E | E / E | E > E | E == E
     | ( E )
     | input                           (read an integer from input stream)
  ```
- Statements
  ```
  S -> X = E;
     | output E;                       (write an integer to output stream)
     | S S
     |
     | if ( E ) { S } [ else { S } ]?  ([]? means optional)
     | while ( E ) { S }
  ```
- Functions: contain a function name, a list of parameters, local variable declarations, a body statement, and a return expression  
  ```
  F -> X ( X, ..., X ) { [ var X, ..., X; ]? S return E; }
  E -> X ( E, ..., E )
  ```
- Records: collection of fields, each having a name and a value
  ```
  E -> { X:E, ..., X:E }               (create records)
     | E.X                             (read field value)
  ```
- Pointers
  ```
  E -> alloc E   (allocate a new cell in the heap initialized with the value of the given expression and results in a pointer to the cell)
     | &X        (create a pointer to a program variable)
     | *E        (dereference a pointer value)
     | null
  S -> *X = E;   (assign values through pointers)
  ```
- Functions as Values
  ```
  E -> E ( E, ..., E )
  ```
- Programs
  ```
  P -> F ... F
  ```

A simplification:  assumption that all declared variable and function names are unique in a program, i.e. that no identifiers is declared more than once.

## 2.3. Normalization

- **normalization**: transform programs into equivalent but syntactically simpler ones
  - pointer dereference: use `*X` rather than `*E`
  - function call: use `X ( X, ..., X )` rather than `E ( E, ..., E )`
- For example, `x = f(y+3)*5;` can be normalized to `t1 = y+3; t2 = f(t1); x = t2*5;`

## 2.4. Abstract Syntax Trees

AST is suitable for **flow-insensitive** analyses which ignore the execution order of statements in a function or block.

For example, type analysis (Chapter 3), control flow analysis (Chapter 9), and pointer analysis (Chapter 10).

## 2.5. Control Flow Graphs

CFG is suitable for For **flow-sensitive** analysis, in particular dataflow analysis (Chapter 5).

A CFG is a directed graph contains:
- nodes: statements
- edges: possible flow of control
- entry: a single point of entry
- exit: a single point of exit

For example, the CFG of
```
iterate(n) {
  var f;
  f = 1;
  while (n>0) {
    f = f*n;
    n = n-1;
  }
  return f;
}
```
